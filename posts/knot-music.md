__What is this music thing?__

I remember listening to my dad's 8-track cassette when I was 4 years old. I was hooked on the White Album!

Since then, it has been a slow but always growing experience to actually participate in music. I did not go to music school. I have not played any major festivals (yet!).

I have played with many good friends and talented musicians.

At this point of the road, I have some ideas and opinions about making music. I like melodies. That said, good rhythmn is even more important! My thoughts go deeper than that. But that is the essential idea.

I invite you to follow me on [instragram](https://www.instagram.com/geoffknot/).

Please do contact me if you are interested in a remix, needing some production, or other collaborations!



There are so many great resources for learning music, if you want it...
