I received this awesome Beato Mugg as a gift. I recognized the Harmonic Minor scale as a metal favorite. The others were modes were obtuse, to say the least. After digging into them, I had a big realization.

This mug is a puzzle, with a simple suprising solution!

All modes of the Double Harmonic Major scale can be considered simply 2 Major chord arpeggios.

Example: C maj7 + C# maj7. 

That's it!
