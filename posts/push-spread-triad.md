Most folks are familiar with the simple triangle shape used to play a triad on Push.

Working to up my game, I wondered about Spread Triads. Spread Triads are a guitar concept that got some attention a couple years ago. How does a Spread Triad look on Push?

To be complete, let's define a spread triad. A basic triad is the well known: 1-3-5.

The Spread Triad is created by skipping steps. The first Spread Triad is therefore: 1 - 5 - 3.

That is to say, the 1, skip the first 3, the 5, skip the next one (the ocave), and then include the next 3.

There are 3 permutations of Spread Triad:

# 1-5-3
# 3 -1-5
# 5-3-1

Here is what the look like on the Ableton Push
