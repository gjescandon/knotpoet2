        Yeh, this is me. I started playing guitar and writing songs way way back in the late 80s. Along the way I have investigated many flavors of rock, jazz, pop, world beats and electronic music. Along the way I have also picked up electric bass and Ableton. For what it's worth, I have taken production and compostion classes with [Pointblank](https://www.pointblankmusicschool.com/courses/online/music-production-and-dj-courses/). I was pleased with the instructors and the course material.
