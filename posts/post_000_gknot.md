Yeh, this is me. I started playing guitar and writing songs way way back in the late 80s. Along the way I have investigated many flavors of rock, jazz, pop, world beats and electronic music. Along the way I have also picked up electric bass and Ableton. 

In this blog, I am sharing points of interest that have expanded my musical awareness. I will not be discussing basic concepts, as so many others are already doing a great job. As needed, I will include links that you can follow to build up yours basic skills.

I invite you to follow me on [instragram](https://www.instagram.com/geoffknot/).

Please do contact me if you are interested in a remix, production support, or other collaborations!
